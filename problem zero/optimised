#A number is a perfect square, or a square number, if it is the square of a positive integer.
#For example, 25 is a square number because 5^2=5*5=25; it is also an odd square.

#The first 5 square numbers are: 1 4 9 16 25, and the sum of the odd squares is 1+9+25=35

#Among the first 852 thousand square numbers, what is the sum of all the odd squares?
