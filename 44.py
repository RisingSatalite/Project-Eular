#Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
#1,5,12,22,35,51,70,92,117,145...

#It can be seen that P4+P7=22+70=92=P8. However, their difference, 70-22=48, is not pentagonal.

#Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D=|Pk-Pj| is minimised; what is the value of ?
